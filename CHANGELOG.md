## [3.13.2]	
- Reunification of the package.
During the 2 week period, we try to keep this package as a compilation of smaller packages. We were successful in separating, getx is well decoupled and it was only necessary to send the internal folders as packages to pub.dev, however, it became very complicated to contribute to the package. This is because it was necessary to clone the repository, replace all pubspec packages with local paths, and after modification, return the original paths to do the PR. With that, the frequency of updates, which was about 4 to 5 days, became almost 2 weeks, and this is not legal for a community as active as Getx, which uses this package precisely in addition to being modern and performance, be constantly improving. This led contributors to the conclusion that getx works best together.
Additional packages will continue to be maintained, and will have the same base as the main package, however, development will take place in the full and main package, and as the addition of new features or bug fixes arrives, we will migrate to the individual packages . Getx reached the mark of 50 contributors today, more than 1500 likes in the pub, and will continue to make development easy.

## [3.8.0]
- Added: Snackbar Status: Open, Opening, Closing and Closed
example:
```dart
 Get.snackbar('title', 'message', snackbarStatus: (status) {
                  if (status == SnackbarStatus.CLOSED) {
                    // made anything
                  }
                });
```

## [3.7.0]
- Added: RxSet. Sets can now also be reactive.
- Added isDesktop/isMobile (@roipeker) 
- Improve GetPlatform: It is now possible to know which device the user is using if GetPlatform.isWeb is true.
context.responsiveValue used device orientation based on web and non-web applications. Now it checks if it is a desktop application (web or desktop application) to do the responsiveness calculation. (@roipeker) 
- Change: The documentation previously stated that Iterables should not access the ".value" property.
However, many users did not pay attention to this fact, and ended up generating unnecessary issues and bugs in their application.
In this version, we focus on code security. Now ".value" is protected, so it cannot be accessed externally by Lists, Maps or Sets.
- Change: Observable lists are now Dart Lists.
There is no difference in your use:
`RxList list = [].obs;`
And you use
`List list = [].obs;`
- Change: You do not need to access the ".value" property of primitives.
For Strings you need interpolation.
For num, int, double, you will have the normal operators, and use it as dart types.
This way, `.value` can be used exclusively in ModelClasses.
Example:

```dart
var name = "Jonny" .obs;
// usage:
Text ("$name");

var count = 0.obs;
// usage:
increment() => count ++;
Text("$count");
```

Thus: List, Map, Set, num, int, double and String, as of this release, will no longer use the .value property.

NOTE:
The changes were not break changes, however, you may have missed the details of the documentation, so if you faced the message: "The member 'value' can only be used within instance members of subclasses of 'rx_list.dart' "you just need to remove the" .value "property from your list, and everything will work as planned.
The same goes for Maps and Sets.

Use `Get.lazyPut<Controller>(()=> Controller(), fenix:true)` to have a controller that after being destroyed, has the ability to be recreated in case someone needs it. This is a function that already exists in smartManagement.keepFactory which is now also possible in full mode.
- Fix native transition on android

## [3.2.2]
- Improve transitions and refactor route system

## [3.2.1]
- Prevent black blackground on cupertino fullscreenDialog

## [3.2.0]
- Improve GetBuilder ram usage
- Added method update to Rx 
Now you no longer need to make an entire class reactive to get an element update from it, you can simply call the update method of its instance, like this:
```dart
class User{
  User(this.name = '', this.age = 0);
  String name; 
  int age;
}

final user = User().obs;

Obx(()=> Text("Name ${user.value.name}: Age: ${user.value.age}"))

// To update:
user.update((user){
user.name = 'Jonny';
user.age = 18;
});
```

Now is also possible to access a value without using the ".value". Just open and close parentheses.
In the previous example, you could do:
```dart
user().name; // before: user.value.name
```
And it is also possible to set a value without using the value, inserting the value directly into the variable.
```dart
user(User('João', 35)); // before: user.value = User('João', 35)
```
Added fenix mode to Get.lazyPut.

## [2.11.3]

## [2.11.2]

- Improvement performance of Obx

## [2.11.1]
- Fixed: oninit calling only once.

## [2.11.0]
- Added Permissions:
You can now revoke permissions to SmartManagement so that it cannot delete a particular controller.
Add to Get.put (Controller(), permanent: true); to make it indelible.
Get.lazyPut() will not receive this resource. Initially he had it, but we saw in internal tests that it could cause problems with the bindings API. Bindings were created to initialize and delete an instance, if it were allowed to make a controller started with lazyPut permanent, copies of that Controller would be created every time Binding was called. For the safety of users, especially new users who could easily do this, it was decided that this feature will only be present in Get.put.
- Improve: Now a controller's life cycle has no connection with the View life cycle. It is no longer called internally in an "initState", it is now called when the Controller enters memory. This means that now onInit will always be called, regardless of where you started your dependency.
- removed: this property of the update() method has been permanently removed.

## [2.10.3]
- GetBuilder refactor. 11% reduction in RAM consumption and 2% in CPU consumption for the sample application. (using as base Flutter for linux desktop).

- The "this" property of the "update" method has been deprecated and will be removed in the next update. Please don't use it anymore. Just use "update()" now.

## [2.10.2]

## [2.10.1]
- Fix broken links on pub
- Fix List empty error

## [2.10.0]
- Added SmartManagement, your application's memory is managed intelligently like never before!
- Added Obx, a widget that knows when to rebuild a child, without needing any type.
- Added MixinBuilder - If you need to use GetBuilder in conjunction with GetX, use GetxController with this widget, and the changes will occur either using update (this) or changing some reactive variable. Use only if necessary, for better RAM consumption, prefer widgets in that order:
Obx => GetX => GetBuilder => MixinBuilder.
Obx is the lightest of all, and MixinBuilder is a mix of the other 3, whenever possible, use the specific widget.
- Refactor: StateManager of Get.
- Changed: full List API refactor, now value is no longer needed.
- Added Workers: You can hear changes to a variable and trigger custom callbacks.
- Added Bindings API docs.
- Added Portuguese language to readme(@Nipodemos)

## [2.6.3]
- Flutter currently has a problem on some devices where using showModalBottomSheet() can cause TextFields to be hidden behind the keyboard (https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/18564) this issue is closed, even users reporting that the problem still occurs.
The problem happens casually, as well as the problem of the snackbar on the iPhone SE 2, and checking the code, I realized that a padding with MediaQuery.of(context).viewInsets.bottom is missing inside the bottomSheet to make it work correctly, since it does not have any constraint with the keyboard.
For stability, I decided not to use the standard Flutter bottomSheet, which contains many bugs, mainly related to keyboard padding, and the lack of respect for topBar's safeArea, and to use a proprietary bottomSheet implementation that is more stable. The Flutter dialog has no problem, so it will be used as the basis for Get.dialog. The bottomSheet will be based on the Flutter bottomSheet Raw API (_ModalBottomSheetRoute), applying bug fixes.

## [2.6.1]

## [2.5.10]
- Removed remnants of previousArgs on routeObserver.
