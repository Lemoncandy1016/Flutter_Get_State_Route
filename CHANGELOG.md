## [3.4.0]
- Added '[everAll]' Worker: Listen a List of '.obx'
- Added Workers dispose
- Fix transition.noTransition
- Fix TextField and VideoPlayController dispose before transition animation

## [3.3.0]
- Fix extensions (@stefandevo)
- Added CPF to utils options (@kauemurakami)
- Added fenix mode to Get.lazyPut. 
Use `Get.lazyPut<Controller>(()=> Controller(), fenix:true)` to have a controller that after being destroyed, has the ability to be recreated in case someone needs it. This is a function that already exists in smartManagement.keepFactory which is now also possible in full mode.
- Fix native transition on android

## [3.2.2]
- Improve transitions and refactor route system

## [3.2.1]
- Prevent black blackground on cupertino fullscreenDialog

## [3.2.0]
- Improve GetBuilder ram usage
- Added method update to Rx 
Now you no longer need to make an entire class reactive to get an element update from it, you can simply call the update method of its instance, like this:
```dart
class User{
  User(this.name = '', this.age = 0);
  String name; 
  int age;
}

final user = User().obs;

Obx(()=> Text("Name ${user.value.name}: Age: ${user.value.age}"))

// To update:
user.update((user){
user.name = 'Jonny';
user.age = 18;
});
```

Now is also possible to access a value without using the ".value". Just open and close parentheses.
In the previous example, you could do:
```dart
user().name; // before: user.value.name
```
And it is also possible to set a value without using the value, inserting the value directly into the variable.
```dart
user(User('João', 35)); // before: user.value = User('João', 35)
```
Added fenix mode to Get.lazyPut.

## [2.11.3]

## [2.11.2]

- Improvement performance of Obx

## [2.11.1]
- Fixed: oninit calling only once.

## [2.11.0]
- Added Permissions:
You can now revoke permissions to SmartManagement so that it cannot delete a particular controller.
Add to Get.put (Controller(), permanent: true); to make it indelible.
Get.lazyPut() will not receive this resource. Initially he had it, but we saw in internal tests that it could cause problems with the bindings API. Bindings were created to initialize and delete an instance, if it were allowed to make a controller started with lazyPut permanent, copies of that Controller would be created every time Binding was called. For the safety of users, especially new users who could easily do this, it was decided that this feature will only be present in Get.put.
- Improve: Now a controller's life cycle has no connection with the View life cycle. It is no longer called internally in an "initState", it is now called when the Controller enters memory. This means that now onInit will always be called, regardless of where you started your dependency.
- removed: this property of the update() method has been permanently removed.

## [2.10.3]
- GetBuilder refactor. 11% reduction in RAM consumption and 2% in CPU consumption for the sample application. (using as base Flutter for linux desktop).

## [2.10.1]

## [2.10.0]
- Added SmartManagement, your application's memory is managed intelligently like never before!
- Added Obx, a widget that knows when to rebuild a child, without needing any type.
- Added MixinBuilder - If you need to use GetBuilder in conjunction with GetX, use GetxController with this widget, and the changes will occur either using update (this) or changing some reactive variable. Use only if necessary, for better RAM consumption, prefer widgets in that order:
Obx => GetX => GetBuilder => MixinBuilder.
Obx is the lightest of all, and MixinBuilder is a mix of the other 3, whenever possible, use the specific widget.
- Refactor: StateManager of Get.
- Changed: full List API refactor, now value is no longer needed.
- Added Workers: You can hear changes to a variable and trigger custom callbacks.
- Added Bindings API docs.
- Added Portuguese language to readme(@Nipodemos)

## [2.6.3]
- Flutter currently has a problem on some devices where using showModalBottomSheet() can cause TextFields to be hidden behind the keyboard (https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/18564) this issue is closed, even users reporting that the problem still occurs.
The problem happens casually, as well as the problem of the snackbar on the iPhone SE 2, and checking the code, I realized that a padding with MediaQuery.of(context).viewInsets.bottom is missing inside the bottomSheet to make it work correctly, since it does not have any constraint with the keyboard.
For stability, I decided not to use the standard Flutter bottomSheet, which contains many bugs, mainly related to keyboard padding, and the lack of respect for topBar's safeArea, and to use a proprietary bottomSheet implementation that is more stable. The Flutter dialog has no problem, so it will be used as the basis for Get.dialog. The bottomSheet will be based on the Flutter bottomSheet Raw API (_ModalBottomSheetRoute), applying bug fixes.

## [2.5.10]
